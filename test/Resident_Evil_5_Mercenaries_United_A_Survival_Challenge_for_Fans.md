Mercenaries United is a minigame that combines the features of two previous modes: The Mercenaries and The Mercenaries Reunion. It is available in the PS4, Xbox One and Switch versions of Resident Evil 5. In this mode, players can choose from 18 different characters, each with their own weapons and skills. The characters include the main protagonists Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar, as well as fan-favorites like Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker, Barry Burton and Rebecca Chambers.
 
The objective of Mercenaries United is to survive as long as possible in one of the eight stages, while killing as many enemies as possible. The stages are based on locations from the main game, such as the Public Assembly, the Mines, the Ship Deck and the Prison. Each stage has its own layout, enemies and hazards. Some stages also feature bosses like the Chainsaw Majini, the Executioner Majini and the Uroboros Mkono.
 
Players have a limited amount of time to complete each stage, but they can extend it by finding and activating time bonuses scattered around the map. They can also increase their score by maintaining a high kill combo and using melee attacks, grenades and environmental objects to deal damage. The score determines the rank that players receive at the end of the stage, from D to SSS. Higher ranks unlock bonus features such as new costumes, weapons and filters.
 
Mercenaries United can be played solo or with another player online or offline. There is also a No Mercy mode that increases the number of enemies and their aggressiveness, making it harder to survive but also more rewarding in terms of score. Mercenaries United is a mode that tests the skills and strategies of Resident Evil fans, offering them a thrilling and addictive experience.
  
To succeed in Mercenaries United, players need to master some tips and tricks that can help them survive longer and score higher. Here are some of them:
 
- Pick up time bonuses. Time bonuses are items that add 60 seconds to the timer, allowing players to extend the stage and earn more points. They are usually hidden or guarded by enemies, so players need to explore the map and find them as soon as possible.
- Keep combo up. Combo is a feature that increases the score for each enemy killed in succession. The higher the combo, the higher the score. To keep the combo up, players need to kill enemies quickly and avoid long gaps between kills. They can also use melee attacks, grenades and environmental objects to kill multiple enemies at once.
- Use character skills. Each character has a unique skill that can give them an edge in combat. For example, Chris can use his boulder punch to deal massive damage, Sheva can use her somersault kick to stun enemies, Jill can use her dodge to evade attacks, Wesker can use his dash to move faster, and so on. Players need to learn how to use these skills effectively and strategically.
- Choose weapons wisely. Each character has a different loadout of weapons and items that they can use in Mercenaries United. Some weapons are more suited for certain stages and enemies than others. For example, shotguns are good for close-range combat and crowd control, rifles are good for long-range sniping and headshots, magnums are good for boss fights and high-damage shots, and so on. Players need to choose their weapons wisely and switch between them as needed.
- Cooperate with partner. Mercenaries United can be played with another player online or offline. Playing with a partner can make the mode easier and more fun, as players can help each other with healing, ammo, time bonuses, combos and strategies. They can also use team attacks to deal more damage and stun enemies. However, playing with a partner also means sharing the score and resources, so players need to cooperate and communicate well with their partner.

Mercenaries United is a mode that challenges players to survive against waves of enemies in different stages. It is a mode that requires skill, strategy and cooperation. It is also a mode that rewards players with high ranks, bonus features and a sense of accomplishment. Mercenaries United is a mode that Resident Evil fans should not miss.
